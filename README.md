# Crypto Challenge
_work in progress..._
### Objective
* To instill basic understanding of cryptography through writing code and explaining the learning process by exploring algorithms related to the problem and its foundations
* All functions written in JavaScript
* Explanations simplified as much as theoretically possible

### Project timeline
* Hopefully, less than one week (starting Feb. 1, 2018)

### Table Of Contents
* Main Page
* [Encoding Magic Numbers: Integers](./problem1/README.md)
* [XOR Foundations](./problem2/README.md)
* [link] XOR cipher
* [link] Detection
* [link] Encryption
* [link] Error-prone coding
* [link] AES-128 in ECB? *what?*
* [link] TBD

#### Note:
I am using [Cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/) as a baseline to jumpstart my learning.  More specifically, this github repo will only cover the first set.  

No answers will be provided to ensure the integrity of the challenge.  Instead, the code posted will cover some variation of the concept the challenge is trying to instill in the challengees.

If any of my code ( or parts of this project ) runs counter to the spirit of the challenge, please let me know.

Thank you for visiting.
